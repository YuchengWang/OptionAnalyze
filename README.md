# Option Analyze using Gemini 2.5 pro

In this demo, we used Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Vertex AI SDK in a Colab Enterprise environment to analyze and visualize options trading data. The notebook showcases how to generate insightful commentary using Gemini's generative capabilities and integrates with Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and plotting. This project highlights how Gemini can serve as an intelligent co-pilot for financial analysis tasks within secure enterprise workflows.
